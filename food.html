            <p> Litti is a main-course dish that forms a part of Bihari cuisine.

                It is nothing, but wheat flour cake that has been salted and baked. Litti is filled with sattu (fried gram flour) and some special spices and served with ghee. Litti is similar to Bati in appearance but there is a little difference. Litti is best eaten with brinjal bharta or mashed potato. Litti-Chokha is now making its presence internationally. The lip-smacking taste of Litti Chokha, savoured by one and all, needs no introduction. It is your grand welcome to the food of Bihar, in all its ghee-dripping glory. It consists of wheat and sattu with spices, kneaded into round spicy balls, dipped in ghee. The texture of Litti along with the crunchy crust makes it a foodie’s delight. Chokha is prepared by mashing boiled vegetables (most common being potatoes, brinjal, tomatoes), adding spices and chopped onion, garlic etc and served with Litti as a complimentary delicacy.

                Sattu or fried gram flour forms a distinctive element of Bihari food and cuisine. The sattu is mixed with spices and filled in wheat dough balls, rolled and cooked with ghee on a hot plate to form sattu paratha which is also called makuni.

            <p> Champaran Meat
                Champaran meat, also known as Ahuna, handi meat, or batlohi, is a dish with its root in Champaran, a district of Bihar. 
                
                 
                
                “Ahuna Mutton Curry” also known as Champaran Mutton – simmered for hours over charcoal in sealed earthen pots. The meat is marinated with onion, crushed ginger-garlic, whole garlic bulb, whole green chilies, freshly made ground spices, turmeric, red chili powder, mustard oil and a bit of ghee to give it that sinful – ready to die for – taste. The mutton is allowed to cook for hours on coal is not stirred by opening the seal and instead shaken with the entire pot from time to time until the meat becomes tender and perfectly succulent. No water is added as the water from mutton and the steam generates inside help the meat cook on its own. The aroma is irresistible.
                
                 
                
                Serve this delicious mutton curry with rice or any Indian flatbread, and salad. </p>

            <p> Bihari Dal Pittha Recipe (Traditional Bihari Delicacy) is a popular rice flour dumplings in Bihari Cuisine. Pitthas are either stuffed with a sweet or spicy filling. There are different varieties of Pitthas. Bihari Dal Pitha is prepared using fresh rice flour and spicy masala lentil filling. The specialty of this dish is that it is vegan, gluten-free, and steamed. High in proteins, this is an anytime snack, loved by all age groups. Pitthas served along with Hari Dhaniya ki Chutney, Tomato Chutney or Mint Chutney can be a delightful starter or a specialty dinner option. This "guilt-free snack" can, not only replace the "fried starters" that many people gorge on during parties but can also satisfy the taste buds when you pop a whole dumpling in your mouth and dig into the yummy spicy filling.Dal Peetha is the Bihari way to cook dumplings or momos. This quintessential food of Bihar is covered with rice flour and stuffed with lentil paste, along with spices and pickle. The dumpling is then steamed or fried and makes for a very healthy breakfast. Another variant of this is when the lentil paste is mixed with spices and rolled into chappatis and is called Dal-Puri.
                ‘Pittha’ is an authentic Bihari nourishment that is tasty & flavorful. </p><ul>
