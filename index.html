            <h3 class="mt-3">History</h3>
            <p> Present-day Bihar is made up of various historical regions. Regions of Bihar such as Magadha , Mithila and Anga are mentioned in religious texts and epics of ancient India. Magadha, in the region of modern-day western Bihar, became the centre of power, education and culture in India for 1000 years. In the Rigvedic period it was ruled by the Brihadratha dynasty. The Haryanka dynasty, founded in 684 BCE, ruled Magadha from the city of Rajagriha (modern Rajgir). Two famous kings of this dynasty were Bimbisara and his son Ajatashatru, who imprisoned his father to ascend the throne. Ajatashatru founded the city of Pataliputra which later became the capital of Magadha. He declared war and won the battle. The Haryanka dynasty was followed by the Shishunaga dynasty. Later the Nanda dynasty ruled over a vast empire extending from Bengal to Punjab. Buddhism in Magadha fell into decline due to the invasion of Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji, during which many of Bihar's world-famous universities of Nalanda and Vikramashila were destroyed. It was claimed that thousands of Buddhist monks were killed during the 12th century. D.N. Jha suggests, instead, that these incidents were the result of Buddhist Brahmin clashes in the struggle for supremacy. In 1540, the chieftain of the great Pashtuns, Sher Shah Suri of Sasaram , defeated Humayun 's Mughal army and took northern India from the Mughals. Sher Shah declared Delhi his capital and from the 11th century to the 20th century, Mithila was ruled by various indigenous dynasties. The first of these was the Karnat dynasty, followed by the Anwar dynasty, the Raghuvanshis and finally the Raj Darbhanga. During this period the capital of Mithila was shifted to Darbhanga.</p><ul>

            <h3 class="mt-3">Language and Festivals</h3>
            <p> Hindi is the official language of Bihar and Urdu is the second official language. Maithili is the only Bihari language included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. Bhojpuri , Magahi , Angika and Bajjika are the other major languages ​​and dialects spoken in Bihar. The major festivals are Chhath , Holi , Diwali , Dussehra , Mahashivratri , Nag Panchami , Shri Panchami, Muharram , Eid and Christmas . Chhathi Maiya, the sixth form of Prakriti and Surya's sister, is worshipped during the festival. It is celebrated six days after Deepavali, or Tihar, on the sixth day of the lunar month of Kartika (October or November) in the Hindu calendar (Vikram Samvat), and hence why it is called Surya Shashti Vrata.[14][15][16] The rituals are observed over three nights and four days. They include holy bathing, fasting, and abstaining from drinking water (as a vrata), standing in water, and offering prasada (prayer offerings) and arghya to the rising and setting of the Sun. Some devotees also perform a prostration march as they head towards the riverbanks. All devotees prepare similar prasada (religious food) and offerings. Being the birthplace of the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji , Patna City (Patna) also witnesses heavy devotion on his birth anniversary. </p><ul>
